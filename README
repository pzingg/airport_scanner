airport_scanner

Uses OS X's "airport" command-line utility to search for open and closed
networks. Just collects the data and sorts by signal strength.  Also
displays base station information read from a YAML database converting
BSSID data to human-usable information.

Have fun using this one!

Just copy base_stations.yml.sample to base_stations.yml, add information
on the closed networks to look for and the model and locations of your
base stations, then run "ruby apscan.rb".
